# Code Your Future "Ship It"

This directory is a boilerplate. It has one file to put your JavaScript in: that's index.js. It has one file to put your CSS in: that's style.css. Both those files are linked in index.html, where you should put your HTML. 

- index.js : JavaScript
- style.css : CSS 
- index.html : HTML, including links to the first two files

You can open this project in Visual Studio Code and code in there, just like you did in Codepen during Intro to Digital.

You can open this project in the browser, and see it working right there on your computer. But you can also ship it: upload it to a hosting site and share it with everyone in the class. And that's what you should do now.
